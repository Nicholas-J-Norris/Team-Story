I woke up in the morning and for breakfast I had Bratwurst and Brot. 
Then I went to the Flughafen in Berlin.
There, I bought some Gebaeck for me and my Hund.
The Baeckerei filled with Brot and Apfelkuchen!
I sat in the biergarten and ate my brot and Apfelkuchen.
The food was so good I forgot I was only wearing my Lederhose.
I walked across the Hauptstrasse to get to the Schloss.
On my way back to the hotel, I found the perfect pair of Lederhose to take home as a souvenir from my wonderful day in Germany.
The Klimaanlage at the hotel was working fine.
I then went to a Ratskeller to enjoy my last night in Germany.
There was a surprise performance by Rammstein in the Ratskeller, which I enjoyed immensely.
