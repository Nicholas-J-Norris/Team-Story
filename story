I woke up in the morning and for breakfast I had Bratwurst and Brot. 
Then I went to the Flughafen in Berlin.
There, I bought some Gebaeck for me and my Hund.
The Baeckerei filled with Brot and Apfelkuchen!
I sat in the biergarten and ate my brot and Apfelkuchen.
The food was so good I forgot I was only wearing my Lederhose.
I walked across the Hauptstrasse to get to the Schloss.
